# In this homework you will compose a short midi composition whose pitch
# (and any other sound attributes you want to include) is controlled by
# 'sonifying' python strings, where each ascii codepoint (character) in a
# string is treated as a midi key number. This works because the standard
# ascii character set (0-127) maps directly onto midi keynums =:).
