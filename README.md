# MUS 305 Computation and Music III Projects (Fall 2021)

This is my repository of projects from [MUS 305: Computation and Music III: Music Representation and Composition](https://taube.web.illinois.edu/mus305/), which I took in the Fall 2021 semester with [Professor Heinrich Taube](https://music.illinois.edu/faculty/heinrich-taube).

Each of the projects was developed using Professor Taube's [`musx` package](https://pypi.org/project/musx/). Several projects also utilize [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) - notably, my final project is a study of music representation & generation for Maguindanaon kulintang music from the Philippines.

I am currently writing documentation & creating audio examples for each project - I'll update this README once those are completed.

An excerpt from the course website about the class topics:

> Computation and Music III (Music Representation and Composition) explores designing, building and using music composition software. The course covers topics such as implementing musical event and container classes, functional tools for manipulating symbolic music information, score file input and output, and scheduling compositional algorithms to create musical output. A variety of different algorithmic techniques for computing compositions will be explored, including topics such as mapping and transformation, musical pattern generation, Markov chains, cellular automata, chaotic systems, microtonality, and spectralism. Example course outcomes include the ability to work with midi data; import, export, and modify score files, sending compositional data in realtime to external apps, and defining data structures to represent common musical concepts such as notes, rhythms, pitches, envelopes, and patterns.
